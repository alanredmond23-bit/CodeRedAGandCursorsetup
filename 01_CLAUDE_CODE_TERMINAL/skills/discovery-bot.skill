  ### 2. EVIDENCE EXTRACTION
  **Objective:** Extract legally significant facts with precise source attribution

  **Extraction Protocol:**

  **Step 1: Identify Factual Assertions**
  - Who, what, when, where, why, how
  - Avoid legal conclusions
  - Distinguish between direct evidence and hearsay
  - Note declarant's personal knowledge basis

  **Step 2: Source Attribution**
  - Document ID + Bates number
  - Page number + line number (for depositions/transcripts)
  - Paragraph/section for documents
  - Timestamp for video/audio
  - Exact quote with quotation marks

  **Step 3: Categorize Evidence Type**
  - DIRECT_TESTIMONY: First-hand witness account
  - DOCUMENTARY: Business records, contracts, emails
  - EXPERT_OPINION: Expert witness statements
  - DEMONSTRATIVE: Photos, diagrams, models
  - REAL: Physical objects, tangible evidence
  - CIRCUMSTANTIAL: Indirect evidence requiring inference

  **Step 4: Assess Evidentiary Value**
  ```python
  def assess_evidentiary_value(fact):
      score = 0

      # Source reliability
      if fact.source_type == "SWORN_TESTIMONY":
          score += 30
      elif fact.source_type == "BUSINESS_RECORD":
          score += 25
      elif fact.source_type == "CASUAL_EMAIL":
          score += 15

      # Corroboration
      score += min(fact.corroborating_sources * 10, 30)

      # Relevance to key issues
      if fact.relates_to_liability:
          score += 20
      if fact.relates_to_damages:
          score += 15

      # Temporal proximity to event
      if fact.contemporaneous:
          score += 10

      # Admissibility likelihood
      if not fact.has_hearsay_issues:
          score += 10
      if fact.authenticated:
          score += 5

      return min(score, 100)
  ```

  **Example Output:**
  ```markdown

  ---

  ## TIMELINE ANALYSIS

  **Critical Period:** February 12 - March 15, 2024 (31 days)
  - Defendant KNEW of defect (Feb 12)
  - Defendant DECIDED to continue sales (Feb 20)
  - Plaintiff injured (March 15)
  - BEFORE any remedial action taken

  **Contradictions Identified:** 3
  1. CEO deposition vs. meeting minutes (knowledge date)
  2. Interrogatory response vs. engineering log (defect awareness)
  3. Marketing materials vs. internal memos (safety claims)

  **Evidence Gaps:**
  - Decision-making process between Feb 13-20 (missing emails?)
  - Quality control reports from February (requested but not produced)
  - Communications with legal counsel (likely privileged)

  **Strategic Implications:**
  - Strong punitive damages case (knew + deliberate disregard)
  - Timeline defeats "no knowledge" defense
  - 31-day window shows causation (defect → incident)
  ```

  ### 5. CONTRADICTION IDENTIFICATION
  **Objective:** Detect inconsistencies in testimony, documents, and evidence

  **Detection Categories:**

  **A. Internal Contradictions**
  - Witness contradicts own prior statement
  - Document conflicts with same party's other documents
  - Deposition testimony vs. interrogatory response

  **B. Cross-Party Contradictions**
  - Plaintiff testimony vs. defendant testimony
  - Competing expert opinions
  - Different versions of same event

  **C. Document vs. Testimony**
  - Witness claims "no email" but email exists
  - Testimony contradicted by contemporaneous records
  - Memory vs. documentary evidence

  **D. Timeline Impossibilities**
  - Claimed sequence of events defies chronology
  - Person claims to be in two places simultaneously
  - Events in wrong order

  **Contradiction Output Format:**
  ```markdown
  ## CONTRADICTION #3 - CEO Knowledge of Defect

  **Contradiction Type:** Testimony vs. Documentary Evidence
  **Severity:** HIGH - Material to liability
  **Confidence:** 94%

  ### STATEMENT A (CEO Deposition)
  **Source:** Deposition of Robert CEO, 2024-10-15
  **Location:** Page 89, Lines 3-12
  **Quote:**
  Q: "When did you first learn about the brake defect?"
  A: "I believe it was sometime in April, after the customer incident was
      reported to our quality team. That was the first I'd heard of any
      brake issues."

  **Date Claimed:** April 2024
  **Knowledge Claimed:** No knowledge before April

  ### STATEMENT B (Meeting Minutes)
  **Source:** Executive Meeting Minutes, 2024-02-20
  **Document:** PROD-2024-005801, Page 3
  **Quote:**
  "CEO Robert opened discussion of brake caliper issue identified by
   Engineering. After review of cost implications, CEO directed that
   current inventory be sold with extended warranty rather than halt
   production."

  **Date:** February 20, 2024
  **Shows:** CEO participated in decision-making about defect

  ### CONTRADICTION ANALYSIS

  **Timeline Discrepancy:**
  - CEO claims April 2024 first knowledge
  - Meeting minutes show February 20, 2024 active participation
  - Difference: **~6 weeks earlier** than claimed

  **Materiality:** CRITICAL
  - Goes to knowledge element of negligence
  - Relevant to punitive damages (conscious disregard)
  - Impeaches CEO credibility as witness

  **Possible Explanations:**
  1. **CEO perjury** (least charitable)
  2. **CEO memory failure** (more charitable but problematic)
  3. **Confusion about "defect" vs "issue"** (semantic but weak)
  4. **Meeting minutes error** (unlikely - corroborated by attendees)

  **Corroboration of Meeting Minutes:**
  - ✓ Manufacturing VP deposition confirms CEO at meeting [DEPO-MVP, p.67]
  - ✓ Meeting agenda shows "brake issue" as Item 4 [PROD-2024-005799]
  - ✓ Follow-up email references "per CEO's decision at yesterday's meeting" [PROD-2024-005810]

  **Recommended Actions:**
  1. **Impeachment Exhibit:** Create side-by-side comparison for trial
  2. **Further Deposition:** Consider recalling CEO or requesting 30(b)(6) designee
  3. **Discovery:** Request all CEO communications Feb 12-28, 2024
  4. **Motion Practice:** May support sanctions motion if perjury clear
  5. **Settlement Leverage:** Strong impeachment evidence increases settlement value

  **Cross-Examination Outline:**
  Q: "You testified you first learned of the brake defect in April, correct?"
  A: [Expected: Yes]
  Q: [Show meeting minutes] "Do you recognize these minutes from February 20?"
  A: [Expected: Yes/Maybe]
  Q: "Were you present at this meeting?"
  A: [Expected: Yes or hedging]
  Q: "Did you direct that defective inventory be sold despite knowing of the defect?"
  A: [Trapped]

  **Confidence in Contradiction:** 94%
  **Basis:**
  - Contemporary documentary evidence (meeting minutes)
  - Multiple corroborations
  - Clear, unambiguous language
  - No reasonable alternative interpretation
  ```

  ```

  **OUTPUT:**
  ```markdown
  # DEPOSITION ANALYSIS - John Smith (Defendant's Quality Manager)
  **Deposition Date:** November 20, 2024
  **Document:** DEPO-SMITH-2024-11-20
  **Pages:** 147
  **Zone:** YELLOW (Discovery Material)
  **Privilege Issues:** NONE DETECTED

  ## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
  Smith testified for 4 hours regarding quality control processes and knowledge
  of brake defect. Provided damaging admissions regarding company's awareness
  and decision not to halt production. Testimony largely consistent with
  documentary evidence but contradicts Interrogatory Response #12.

  ## KEY FACTS EXTRACTED: 23

  ### FACT #1 - Quality Testing Inadequate
  **Quote:** "We didn't perform weld strength testing on every unit. That would
           be cost-prohibitive. We did sample testing - maybe 1 in 50."
           [p.34, lines 8-11]
  **Significance:** Insufficient testing may have missed defect
  **Confidence:** 98%
  **Legal Impact:** Supports negligence (failure to test)

  ### FACT #2 - Aware of Chen's Report
  **Quote:** "Yes, Sarah [Chen] sent me her engineering log entry about the
           brake weld issue. That was mid-February I think." [p.56, lines 15-17]
  **Significance:** Corroborates Chen testimony, establishes notice to QC
  **Confidence:** 97%
  **Cross-Reference:** Chen Depo p.47; Engineering Log PROD-2024-005678

  [... 21 more facts ...]

  ## CONTRADICTIONS IDENTIFIED: 2

  ### CONTRADICTION #1
  **Deposition Statement:** "I never recommended halting production" [p.89, line 12]
  **Conflicts With:** Email from Smith to Manufacturing VP [PROD-2024-005823]
  **Email Quote:** "I strongly recommend we halt brake assembly production until
                  weld issue is resolved"
  **Severity:** HIGH
  **Confidence:** 95%

  ## TIMELINE ENTRIES: 8
  [Timeline entries extracted and added to master timeline]

  ## PRIVILEGE REVIEW
  - ✓ No privileged communications identified
  - ✓ Attorney present during deposition (opposing counsel)
  - ✓ No improper questions regarding attorney communications

  ## ADMISSIBILITY ISSUES
  - None identified - Smith had personal knowledge of all testimony
  - Business records authenticated during deposition
  - No hearsay concerns for Smith's own observations

  ## STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT
  **Overall Value:** HIGH - Damages case significantly
  **Impeachment Potential:** MODERATE - One significant contradiction
  **Trial Testimony:** Smith would be damaging witness for defense

  ## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
  1. Highlight Facts #2, #7, #12 in summary judgment brief
  2. Prepare impeachment exhibit for Contradiction #1
  3. Request production of all Smith emails Feb-March 2024 (may have more contradictions)
  4. Consider calling Smith as adverse witness at trial

  ## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
  **Overall Analysis Confidence:** 94%
  **Basis:** Clear testimony, strong documentary corroboration, minimal ambiguity

  **Attorney Review Required:** YES - Before using in motion or at trial
  ```

  ## ERROR HANDLING
