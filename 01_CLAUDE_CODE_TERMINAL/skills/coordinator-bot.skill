  PARALLEL TASKS: Evidence Review, Expert Declaration, Exhibit Compilation

  ```

  **Workflow Optimization Recommendations:**
  ```markdown
  ## WORKFLOW ANALYSIS - Summary Judgment Opposition

  **Current Timeline:** 14 days to deadline
  **Estimated Completion:** 13 days (92% confidence)
  **Risk Level:** MODERATE

  ### CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS
  Longest path: Legal Research (3d) → Draft (5d) → Review (2d) → Revisions (2d) → Filing (1d) = 13 days
  Buffer: 1 day (7% margin for error)

  ### BOTTLENECKS IDENTIFIED
  1. **Senior Partner Review** (2 days scheduled)
     - Partner has 3 other matters requiring review same week
     - **Recommendation:** Schedule specific review time slot NOW
     - **Alternative:** Assign to other senior attorney if primary unavailable

  2. **Expert Declaration** (dependent on expert availability)
     - Expert historically slow to respond
     - **Recommendation:** Contact expert TODAY with firm deadline
     - **Contingency:** Have backup expert opinion ready

  ### OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
  1. **Parallelize Evidence Review:** Assign to Discovery Bot (saves 2 days attorney time)
  2. **Advance Exhibit Compilation:** Start now instead of waiting for draft completion
  3. **Pre-schedule Review Time:** Block partner calendar for 12/21 AM
  4. **Draft Declarations in Advance:** Don't wait for opposition to be complete

  ### RECOMMENDED TIMELINE (OPTIMIZED)
  ```
  12/16: Legal Research (Attorney Chen) [PARALLEL]
  12/16: Evidence Review (Discovery Bot) [PARALLEL]
  12/16: Contact Expert re: Declaration [PARALLEL]
  12/17-12/19: Draft Opposition (Attorney Smith)
  12/18: Expert submits draft declaration
  12/19: Compile Exhibit Binder (Paralegal Rodriguez)
  12/20: Finalize Exhibits + Expert Signature
  12/21 AM: Senior Partner Review (PRE-SCHEDULED)
  12/21 PM-12/22: Revisions
  12/22 EOD: Final Proofread
  12/23: File Opposition
  ```

  **Projected Completion:** 12/23 by 5:00 PM (2 days before buffer)
  **Confidence:** 95% (assuming expert cooperation and no major issues in review)
  ```

  |----------|----------|-------|----------------|----------------|
  | Smith    | 92%      | 3     | 5              | ⚠️ OVERLOADED - Reallocate |
  | Chen     | 73%      | 2     | 2              | ✅ OPTIMAL |
  | Rodriguez| 68%      | 2     | 1              | ✅ OPTIMAL |
  | Martinez | 45%      | 1     | 0              | ⬇️ UNDERUTILIZED - Assign more |

  ### REALLOCATION RECOMMENDATIONS

  **Recommendation #1:**
  - **Task:** Exhibit Binder Compilation (Smith v. ACME)
  - **From:** Attorney Smith (92% → 85%)
  - **To:** Paralegal Jones (45% → 58%)
  - **Reason:** Free up Smith for critical tasks (SoL filing, MSJ opposition)
  - **Impact:** Reduces Smith's critical path time by 6 hours
  - **Action:** APPROVE & REASSIGN

  **Recommendation #2:**
  - **Task:** Client Interview - Initial Discovery (Johnson v. XYZ)
  - **From:** Attorney Smith (85% → 78%)
  - **To:** Attorney Martinez (45% → 60%)
  - **Reason:** Martinez has availability and appropriate experience level
  - **Impact:** Further reduces Smith workload, increases Martinez utilization
  - **Action:** APPROVE & REASSIGN

  **Recommendation #3:**
  - **Task:** Discovery Bot Review & Validation (Smith v. ACME)
  - **From:** Manual attorney review
  - **To:** Discovery Bot with Attorney Chen spot-check
  - **Reason:** AI can process 500 pages/hour vs. 20 pages/hour manual
  - **Impact:** Saves 15 attorney hours
  - **Action:** IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY

  ### POST-REALLOCATION PROJECTIONS

  | Attorney | Current | Projected | Status |
  |----------|---------|-----------|--------|
  | Smith    | 92%     | 78%       | ✅ OPTIMAL |

  **OUTPUT:**
  ```markdown
  🚨 DEADLINE CRISIS - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

  ### RESOURCE REALLOCATION
  - **Lead Attorney:** Chen (replacing Smith)
  - **Supporting Attorney:** Rodriguez (freed from other matters)
  - **Paralegal Support:** Jones + Martinez (full-time on this)

  ### CONTINGENCY PLANS
  - **Plan B:** If extension denied, file emergency motion for time
